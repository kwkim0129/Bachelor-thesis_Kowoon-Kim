[How to run the code]
Access the software via: https://lehre.bpm.in.tum.de/ports/5000/

You can download the YAML files in the following websites and use them as an input for the software:
1. manufacturing data: https://zenodo.org/records/7958478
2. public transport data: https://zenodo.org/records/7411234

In case the conversion of the YAML into CSV takes too long, just use the "Use existing CSV" dropdown in the software to try it out.
